This is a demo of a simple web chat app using golang and websockets.

To get the files

<code>git clone https://github.com/Niessy/websocket-golang-chat.git

<code>go install</code>

Note that in order to call the binary from any folder you have to change the path in line 17 to

<code>"Users/YOURNAME/PATH_OF_GO_SOURCE_TO_FILE/chat.html"</code>

If your not going to need to call it from anywhere but the current folder then dont do anything.
